# Sql_table_to_csv
With this piece of python code, you can convert any table from your SQL database (eg - MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.) to CSV format.

To use this code, you need to replace the following placeholders with your own information:

1. Replace 'your server name' with the name of your SQL Server instance.
2. Replace 'your database name' with the name of your database.
3. Replace 'table name' with the name of the table you want to export.
4. Specify the desired file name and path for the output CSV file by replacing 'output.csv' with your preferred name.
5. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to connect to the SQL Server and access the specified database and table.

After making these modifications, run the code to export the table data to the specified CSV file. The resulting CSV file will be created in the same directory where your Python script is located
